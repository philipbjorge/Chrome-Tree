Chrome-Tree
===========

# Abandoned (for now)
As it stands, I could not come up with any solutions or clever hackery to override the back/forward buttons, making this extension effectively useless.
Perhaps in the future the chrome API or HTML5 History API will provide fuller access to the back stack.

## Details
A Google Chrome extension that replaces the standard back/forward stack with a tree.

State:
Nearing initial release (see issues page).

The major issue to resolve is overriding Chrome's standard back/forward stack as using it causes my extension to lose track of its internal state.

Notes:
Using "stock" dynatree with the exception that icons can be linked from external sources (favicons)
